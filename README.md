Load data: The code loads anatomical data from a CSV file. You can customize this to load data from other sources, such as a database or API.
Define functions: The generate_quiz function creates personalized quizzes based on user progress. The analyze_user_progress and generate_questions_for_area functions are placeholders for your custom logic to analyze user performance and generate appropriate questions.
Quiz structure: The QuizQuestion class defines the structure of a quiz question, including the question itself, the correct answer, and incorrect options.
Quiz generation: The code generates a sample quiz based on the QuizQuestion class. You can customize this to generate more complex and varied quizzes.
User interaction: The code simulates a simple user interaction with the quiz, but you can replace this with a more sophisticated user interface.
Next steps:

Implement the analyze_user_progress and generate_questions_for_area functions using machine learning techniques or other appropriate methods.
Expand the quiz data to include more questions and cover a wider range of anatomical topics.
Integrate the quiz system with a 3D anatomy model using a suitable 3D engine.
Add features such as progress tracking, leaderboards, and feedback mechanisms.
